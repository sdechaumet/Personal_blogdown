For some times now, I'm doing car and motorbike maintenance myself, but I never got to the decoating step, neither the rust treatement and painting. But I always had an interest into those things, so when my friends told me about the [4L Trophy](https://www.4ltrophy.com) : a french humanitarian raid to Maroc done in a common old car : the [Renault 4L](https://www.google.fr/search?q=Renault+4L&num=20&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwji4cn3l-PUAhVJWxoKHXwSDZQQ_AUICigB&biw=1920&bih=988), it gaves me the perfect occasion to find an old car and do a 'full' or 'partially complete' restoration. So we created an association, find some cars and began the repair !
